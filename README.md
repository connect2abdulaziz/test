## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to set up the following environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add these variables with appropriate values:

- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (`development`, `production`, etc.)
- `APP_PORT` - Port number for the server (e.g., `3000`)
- `DB_USERNAME` - Username for PostgreSQL database
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Password for PostgreSQL database
- `DB_NAME` - Name of the PostgreSQL database
- `DB_HOST` - Hostname for PostgreSQL database
- `DB_PORT` - Port number for PostgreSQL database
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for JWT encryption
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - Expiration time for JWT tokens (e.g., `7d` for 7 days)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Email address for the admin user
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for the admin user

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=development
APP_PORT=3000
DB_USERNAME=myusername
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_NAME=mydatabase
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword
```

## Installation

## bash
```
npm run seed:all
```


## Usage
After installation and setup, you can start the server with:
